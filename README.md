# Sentinel AI 🚨
*A Real-Time Emergency Detection System for Public Safety*

## 🧠 Overview

**Sentinel AI** is an AI-powered surveillance solution developed to revolutionize emergency detection in public environments. Designed during the **KEC Ideathon 2025**, this system identifies critical incidents like **violence, falls, crashes, or fires** from live video feeds and immediately alerts authorities — all while respecting privacy and reducing costs.

> 🏆 Awarded **3rd Place** at KEC Ideathon 2025

- Compatibility with **existing CCTV infrastructure**
- A system that is **affordable**, **efficient**, and **ethical**

---

## ✨ Features

- Detects multiple emergency scenarios:
  - Violence
  - Road accidents
  - Human falls
  - Fire hazards
- Sends contextual **real-time alerts**
- **No new hardware** required – works with current CCTV feeds
- Uses **face anonymization** to ensure personal privacy
- Can be deployed in **public places**, **offices**, **transport stations**, etc.

## 🔬 Comparative Advantage

| Existing Solution            | Limitations                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CCTV + Security Guards       | Manual, error-prone, lacks automation           |
| Ring/Nest Cameras            | Designed for home use, not scalable publicly    |
| ShotSpotter                 | Only detects gunshots, expensive                |
| AI Cams (Axis/Hikvision)    | Expensive, privacy concerns, proprietary        |
| Cloud AI (AWS/Google)       | Complex setup, high cost                        |
| Drones                      | Not ideal indoors, restricted legally           |
| Panic Buttons               | Manual, lacks automation and context            |

Sentinel AI solves these gaps by being:
- **Real-time**
- **Privacy-conscious**
- **Cost-efficient**
- **Public-scale ready**
